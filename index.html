          <h3>Microbike</h3>
          <p>A project that I did my sophomore year of college where I designed and manufactured a small electric motorcycle that could reach speeds of 35mph.</p>

          <div id="planter"></div>
          <h3>Self-Watering Planter</h3>
          <p>A project that I completed in the fall semester of my junior year that measured soil moisture levels and ambient room lighting in order to keep a plant healthy. It would activate a pump to water the plant if the soil moisture levels were too low and would adjust the light coming from the on-board LEDs to make up for the lack of light in the room (if necessary).</p>

          <div id="thermostat"></div>
          <h3>Self-Adjusting Thermostat</h3>
          <p>A side project that I completed in my junior year that turns on my heater in the morning because I donâ€™t like waking up to a cold apartment. Uses two servo motors attached to 3D printed fingers that connect to a Wi-Fi adapter that turns up the heat when it reaches 30 min before wake up time.</p>

        <section>
          <div id="cribbage"></div>
          <h3>Automatic Cribbage</h3>
          <p>A project I did my spring semester of my junior year where I designed, manufactured, and programmed an automatic Cribbage board that would help children learn how to play Cribbage and improve their counting skills. </p>

          <h2>A little bit about me...</h2>
          <p>My name is Bryce Copenhaver and I am a senior of robotics engineering at the polytechnic campus of Arizona State University. My passions include work in autonomous vehicles as well as designing crappy robots to make my everyday life easier. This website is a brief introduction into the work that I have done over my years in college. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
